# pdf2html

This project is a lightweight HTTP(S) interface to the [pdf2htmlex library](https://pdf2htmlex.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/).

## Licensing

Since pdf2htmlex is licensed under the GPL, this project is too (see the LICENSE.TXT file).

As you can see from the build process, pdf2htmlEX itself is patched by the patches within this project (see [src/Pdf2Html/patches](tree/src/Pdf2Html/patches)), based on a clone of the upstream project tag we are targeting. As such we have not repeated pdf2htmlEX's source code here; you can find it via the link above.
